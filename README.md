# README - Web Scraping Automation Agent Design

## Project Description
This project, developed in May 2024, aims to design an automated web scraping platform that allows users to extract structured data from websites using a simple prompt. The tool leverages advanced technologies to bypass common web scraping limitations while offering an intuitive interface for the user.

## Main Features
- Automated extraction of structured data from websites.
- Implementation of advanced mechanisms to bypass captchas and other anti-scraping barriers.
- Creation of an intuitive user interface with Streamlit to simplify interaction with the platform.

## Tech Stack
The project is built on a set of robust and proven technologies:
- **Selenium**: Browser automation for dynamic scraping.
- **Requests**: HTTP requests to retrieve static data.
- **Python**: Primary programming language used for project development.
- **Groq API**: Utilization of advanced language models to optimize interactions and extractions.
- **Streamlit**: User interface providing a smooth and interactive experience.
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Integration of language processing models to aid in data analysis and extraction.
- **AI Agent**: Task automation based on the specific needs of the user.
